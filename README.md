# Duke project template

This is a project template for a greenfield Java project. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 25, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 25** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

# Echo user guide

Echo is a todo list chatbot that responds to various specific commands. It can add 3 different types
of tasks, delete tasks, mark tasks and so on. Echo stores all tasks in the todo list in a text file.

## How to run

Open a terminal and navigate to the file directory where the jar file is stored.

Run: ```java -jar [name of jar file]```

To help avoid any issues use Java 25.

## Echo commands and usages

1. ```todo```
   - Adds a todo task that only contains a description.
   - Example usage: ```todo Do the dishes```
2. ```deadline```
   - Adds a deadline task that contains a description and a deadline date, and optionally a deadline time.
   - Example usage: ```deadline Do homework /2023-12-23```
   - Example usage 2: ```deadline Do homework /2023-12-23 /1200```
3. ```event```
   - Adds an event task that contains a description, start date and end date, and optionally the times
   associated with the dates.
   - Example usage: ```event Holiday /2023-10-21 /2023-10-23 /1200 /1400```
   - The first date is the start date and similarly the first time is the start time.
   - The second date would be the end date, and the second time is the end time.
4. ```list```
   - Causes Echo to list all the tasks currently stored in the todo list.
   - Everything after list is ignored by Echo.
   - Example usage: ```list```
5. ```delete```
   - Deletes a task stored by the todo list, at the position specified by the integer argument provided.
   - Example usage: ```delete 2``` - deletes the task at position 2 of the list.
   - Position provided must be a positive integer.
6. ```mark``` and ```unmark```
   - Marks/unmarks a task stored by the todo list, at the position specified by the integer argument provided.
   - Example usage: ```mark 2``` - marks the task at position 2 of the list.
   - Position provided must be a positive integer.
7. ```find```
   - Finds the tasks stored by the todo list containing the word/string specified by the argument provided.
   - Example usage: ```find work``` - finds all the tasks in the list that contain 'work', such as 'Do work',
   'Work on project' etc.
8. ```undo```
   - Reverses the previous command that made a change to the list. So ```todo Work``` would be undone but not
   ```mark 2``` if the task at position 2 of the list was already marked.
   - The program can only reverse the previous 2 actions.
   - Example usage: ```undo```
9. ```bye```
   - Causes Echo to display a farewell message and exits the program.
   - Example usage: ```bye```

## Other notes

- Do not edit the text file used to store the tasks as it has to be in a specific format for the program to work.
If any accidental changes are made simply remove the changes, or clear all text in the text file.
